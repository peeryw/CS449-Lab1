# CS449-Lab1
UMKC COMP-SCI 449 Foundations of Software Engineering Lab1 Assignment

The lab assignment is to create an Android application that can function as a ball-strike 
counter an umpire might use during a baseball game to keep track of the count for a batter.
For now, the application only needs to keep track of balls and strikes for a single batter. 
If the count reaches 3 strikes first, your application should display a dialog box announcing the batter is “Out!” 
If the count reaches 4 balls first, your application should display a dialog box announcing “Walk!” 
After either one, the count should be reset for the next batter.
